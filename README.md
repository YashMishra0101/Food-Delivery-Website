Hi, I’m Tarun Banafar, a student from Pune, India, and this is my **Fast Food Delivery App**. The goal of this project is to offer a smooth and convenient food ordering experience. I built this app using **React**, **Redux**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase**, and I'm constantly learning new things to make it better.  

## About Me – **Tarun Banafar**

I am currently studying **MCA (Master of Computer Applications)** in Pune, India. This app is part of my journey as a student, where I am learning how to build full-fledged applications with modern technologies. I am trying to improve my skills every day and, through projects like this, I am learning how to create real-world solutions.  

## Key Features

### **Menu and Item Filtering**
- The app has a menu with different food items. You can explore and filter the items according to your preferences, whether you’re craving a burger, pizza, or any other dish. It’s all about making it easier for you to find what you want.

### **Shopping Cart Management**
- Adding and removing items from the cart is super easy. I’ve made sure that the total price is updated instantly, so you always know exactly what you’re paying for before checking out.

### **User Authentication**
- I’ve used Firebase to set up secure user authentication. You can sign up with your email and password to keep your orders safe and access your account anytime.

### **Easy Address Entry**
- When ordering, you can manually enter your delivery address or let the app detect your location using geolocation. It’s simple and quick to ensure the right address every time.

### **Order Creation**
- Once you’ve selected your items, you can go ahead and complete your order with just a few clicks. It’s designed to make your ordering process smooth and quick.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The app is built with React because it helps in building dynamic, fast, and interactive user interfaces. React’s component-based structure made it easy for me to manage and render content efficiently.

- **Redux**: I used Redux for state management to keep track of user data and cart items. It helps in managing state across different parts of the app.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS was used for styling the app because it makes it easy to create responsive and modern layouts with utility classes.

- **Firebase**: Firebase was a great choice for user authentication because it’s easy to integrate, secure, and handles all the backend logic.
